                    <p>The vibe at Cafe Ambrosia is really fun, with a great selection of songs playing in the
                        background. It’s a perfect spot to sit and work, thanks to the beautiful blend of natural and
                        ambient lighting. Open windows, high ceilings, and low-hanging lamps create a relaxed, airy
                        feel. The decor is minimalist, very open, and inspired by Greek and French styles. Plus, there’s
                        free Wi-Fi, which makes it easy to spend the whole day there.</p>

                    <p>I ordered a vanilla latte (around $7), and it was really fresh. The vanilla flavor wasn’t
                        overpowering — it had a light, earthy taste with subtle hints of chocolate and even a slight
                        tea-like note. The menu is basic but covers everything you’d expect from a good café.</p>
                    <p> P.S. Be sure to try their Tiramisu Latte — it’s what they’re famous for!</p> Bye!

                    <p>Ten Thousand Coffee, originally based out of Australia (I think!), has a very modern vibe with
                        minimalist decor. The interior is clean and bright, with white and wooden accents. Although the
                        store itself has mostly low seating, there’s plenty of public seating available outside. When I
                        visited, the café was very busy and a bit noisy — probably because it’s so close to Times
                        Square. I tried to sit and work but found it a little difficult with the heavy customer traffic.
                        That said, it’s still a great spot for a quick walk-in, grab a drink, and take a breather.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the coffee, I ordered a vanilla latte (around $6) to compare it with other coffee shops. The
                        latte was chocolaty, light-roasted, and very creamy — something you could easily drink every
                        day. I also ordered their Strawberry Cream Latte (about $7), which is one of their newer
                        offerings. It was exceptionally creamy and genuinely tasted like chocolate-covered strawberries
                        — absolutely delicious!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        P.S. Definitely try their matcha drinks — they’re super creative with those too!

                    <p>
                        This café came highly recommended, and it’s easy to see why. % Arabica, originally based out
                        of Japan, offers simple yet specialty coffee. I’ve been here before, and the interior always
                        stands out — very futuristic with beige and yellowish tones. While there's plenty of space
                        to stand or perch, there were no tables to place your coffee or sit down for an extended
                        time. That might be intentional, as it’s located in an area surrounded by offices. The
                        fast-paced energy — office chatter, ambient music, and a steady stream of professionals —
                        gives you the sense that this is a quick-stop coffee spot, not a sit-down café.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I ordered the Iced Kyoto Latte (around $7), one of their bestsellers. It was sweet, creamy,
                        and easy to drink — with none of the bitterness you'd expect from a cold coffee. Honestly,
                        you could finish it in one go. That may be a win for some, though coffee purists might find
                        it too mellow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also tried the Vanilla Latte ($6.50 for a large), which was surprisingly affordable. It
                        had a very creamy texture and delivered everything you’d expect from a well-made coffee,
                        though it lacked the sharp bitterness of an espresso shot or traditional drip brew. The
                        smooth balance of sweetness and richness made it quite distinct.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        P.S. Don’t skip the Espresso Tonic — exceptionally refreshing and unlike your usual coffee
                        experience.

                    <p>
                        Pull Tab is the brand's only NYC — and possibly only U.S. — location, and its name is
                        inspired by bottle caps you “pull” off (there’s even a painting that illustrates this). The
                        brand hails from China, though its interior doesn’t reflect that heritage directly. Instead,
                        it leans into a cool, gray-toned aesthetic with a hipster vibe — skateboards and surfboards
                        on display — and minimal but sufficient seating for about 12 people. While space is limited,
                        it’s still a decent place to sit and work. And with Bryant Park just around the corner, the
                        location has a strong “Z factor”: grab a drink and head to the park for a more relaxed
                        experience. I know I would.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I ordered the Iced Orange Americano (around $7), one of their newest offerings. It’s
                        literally an Americano poured over orange juice — definitely unexpected. The coffee flavor
                        peeked through but was mostly overtaken by the citrusy sweetness. Still, a fun drink if
                        you’re feeling adventurous.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also tried their Signature Aerofoam Coffee ($7.50), which seems to be their own invention
                        (possibly patented). It resembled milk topped with a thick, airy coffee foam. As I sipped
                        and stirred, the foam gradually mixed into the milk, subtly shifting the flavor with every
                        sip. Creamy, interesting, and genuinely enjoyable — definitely worth trying at least once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for the base Vanilla Latte ($5.25), it was exactly what you’d expect from a reliable
                        everyday coffee. But since Pull Tab’s focus is clearly on specialty drinks, I’d recommend
                        branching out and trying something new.
                    </p>
                    <p>P.S. Pair your coffee with their butter toast — it was genuinely delicious.
                    </p>
