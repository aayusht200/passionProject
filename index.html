                    <h4>My Two Cents Date: April 27<sup>th</sup> 2025</h4>
                    <p>The vibe at Cafe Ambrosia is really fun, with a great selection of songs playing in the
                        background. It’s a perfect spot to sit and work, thanks to the beautiful blend of natural and
                        ambient lighting. Open windows, high ceilings, and low-hanging lamps create a relaxed, airy
                        feel. The decor is minimalist, very open, and inspired by Greek and French styles. Plus, there’s
                        free Wi-Fi, which makes it easy to spend the whole day there.</p>

                    <p>I ordered a vanilla latte (around $7), and it was really fresh. The vanilla flavor wasn’t
                        overpowering — it had a light, earthy taste with subtle hints of chocolate and even a slight
                        tea-like note. The menu is basic but covers everything you’d expect from a good café.</p>
                    <p> P.S. Be sure to try their Tiramisu Latte — it’s what they’re famous for!</p> Bye!

                    <p>Ten Thousand Coffee, originally based out of Australia (I think!), has a very modern vibe with
                        minimalist decor. The interior is clean and bright, with white and wooden accents. Although the
                        store itself has mostly low seating, there’s plenty of public seating available outside. When I
                        visited, the café was very busy and a bit noisy — probably because it’s so close to Times
                        Square. I tried to sit and work but found it a little difficult with the heavy customer traffic.
                        That said, it’s still a great spot for a quick walk-in, grab a drink, and take a breather.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the coffee, I ordered a vanilla latte (around $6) to compare it with other coffee shops. The
                        latte was chocolaty, light-roasted, and very creamy — something you could easily drink every
                        day. I also ordered their Strawberry Cream Latte (about $7), which is one of their newer
                        offerings. It was exceptionally creamy and genuinely tasted like chocolate-covered strawberries
                        — absolutely delicious!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        P.S. Definitely try their matcha drinks — they’re super creative with those too!
                    </p>

                        Bye!
